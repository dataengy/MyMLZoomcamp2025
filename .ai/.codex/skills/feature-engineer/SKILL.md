# Feature Engineering

## Workflow

- Inspect existing features and identify types (numeric, categorical, datetime, text).
- Propose candidate transformations with brief rationale.
- Implement the requested features in a reproducible pipeline step.
- Evaluate impact using a quick model and feature importance.
- Save new feature definitions or code in `src/` (or `notebooks/` if exploratory).

## Output

- List of created features, code location, and measured impact.
